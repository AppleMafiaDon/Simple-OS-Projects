In this program you are able to operate any of the standard shell commands
(e.g. ls, cat, pw, rm, etc.) as you would in any other shell with the same
parameters and help features. However, I have added 4 commands as part of this
shell which are not standard and will require some explanation on how to use
them.

********************************************************************************
For all commands you may replace the parameter or switch with -h and a help
blurb will appear describing the function of the command.
********************************************************************************

They are:

exit [n] - parameter n - Non-zero integer
This command will terminate the shell with a code of 0 if no parameter is
given. However, if a value is provided this is the status code which will be
provided on termination.


prompt <newPrompt> - parameter newPrompt - A string
This command will change the prompt displayed when a new command is expected.
If no parameter is provided it will be set to the default of 'cwushell>'.
Otherwise, the 'newPrompt' will become the new prompt.


cpuinfo -[c|t|n] - switch - values c or t or n
This function will provide information about the CPU you are currently using.
The switch is required for the command to work. 
With a value of 'c' it will print the cpu clock.
With a value of 't' it will print the cpu type.
With a value of 'n' it will print the number of cores.


meminfo -[t|u|c] - switch - values t or u or c
This function will provide you information about the system memory being used.
The switch is required for the command to work.
With a value of 't' it will print the total RAM memory in in bytes.
With a value of 'u' it will print the used RAM memory.
With a value of 'c' it will print the size of the L2 cache/core in bytes.

Don't forget, to view this file again just use the command 'manual'!
Happy shelling!
